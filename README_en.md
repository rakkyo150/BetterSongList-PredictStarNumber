# BetterSongList + PredictStarNumber

A version of [Better Song List](https://github.com/rakkyo150/BeatSaber_BetterSongList) with [PredictStarNumber](https://github.com/rakkyo150/).  
I actually wanted to separate it from Better Song List, but it was difficult to access Better Song List.  
so I released it as a modified version of Better Song List.  
Supported beat saver versions are 1.19.0 and above.

## Differences from the original version
You can use the function to display the result of [PredictStarNumber](https://github.com/rakkyo150/PredictStarNumber) in unranked score.
